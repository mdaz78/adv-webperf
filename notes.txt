Resource Discovery Queue

- Cache headers per file
  - Absolute expiration data (HTTP 1.0)
  - Relative expiration date (HTTP 1.1)
  - More specs / values



When browser needs a resource
1 -> It checks the Cache
  A) Cache Miss: we go to the network and fetch It
  B) Cache HIT:
    i) Is it expired
      => makes a conditional request
      => Server can respond with
        => Not modified (updated cache header)
        => Modified, Server sends a new file
    ii) if not expired => we use the file from the Cache

[ It is always a good idea to keep static expiration date in the far future ]
